            You will need to create a form for taking in input. Remember the input has to be valid,
            so you will have to check the data somewhere. The best way is to pass any relevant information that is
            needed to this page (such as artists, metadata type id's or values) and then manage the display similar to what is
            done in the drop down menu for the search bar
