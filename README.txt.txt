HELLO USER
For this stickman challenge 2 code here, it compiles and configures successfully.

Here, you can move easily left and right by pressing the keys, and once you let go any of the keys, the movement stops. To jump, you can jump as high as you want.
You have to keep holding the up button, to jump as high as u want, and then let go to come back down fast.

In this game, you have three lives. Every time an enemy touches you, or you touch an enemy you die, and respawn.
REMEMBER, if you let go off the jump button when you are on top of an enemy, you will die

The platforms are setup, so that you cant pass through them, but you can jump onto them automatically.

For the level file, you can add more enemies inside the enemy boundary and just name your images, starting with "slime".
You can also add more platforms, by adding them in the platform boundary and just name your images starting with "foot_tile".
You can also change any of the positions of any entities, and can also make any enemy move, by simple writing "move" in its strategy boundary.

The finishline is the length of the level width, so the line will always be at the very hand

Thankyou, and have fun playing the game.
